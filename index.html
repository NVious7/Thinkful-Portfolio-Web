                <h2>This is Me. Keithan Van.</h2>
                <p>I am a software developer, currently residing in Jacksonville, Florida.</p>
                <p>There are many things that I am interested in, but here is a list of just a few of them:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bodybuilding/Weightlifting</li>
                    <li>K-Dramas</li>
                    <li>Anime</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am currently in college pursuing a <span>Bachelor of Arts</span> degree in <span>Psychology</span>. Even though I am too far into my degree to change now for a Computer Science degree, I still have a passion for technology, software, and coding.</p>
                <p>Becoming a student <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" target="_blank"><span>@Thinkful<span></a> felt like the real first step in my journey to becoming an <span class="i">Experienced</span> and <span class="i">Confident</span> Software Developer. The best decision I've made yet on this path.</p>
                <p>I would love to work on a team of other passionate developers and gain more knowledge and learn from others.</p>
                <p>Outside of the Software world, I love to better my mental and physical health with other interests such as seriously hitting the gym heavy and dirty bulking but also by taking walks with my Fiancé and spending time with her and our cute bunny.</p>
